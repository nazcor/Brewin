# Brewin#

Meet the Brewin# Interpreter, a computer program written completely in Python and created specifically for a fictional language presented in UCLA Fall 2023's Computer Science 131 course. Reflecting other object-oriented languages, this interpreter supports objects, prototypical inheritance, lambdas/closures, and much more.
